<h1>My School</h1>

I am a junior at the University of New Haven. I major in criminal justice with a concentration in investigative services. When I graduate, I hope to become a crime scene technican. Eventually I plan to be a crime scene investigator.  
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

For fun I like to go off roading in my Jeep. I often find trails that lead to water or small mountains to climb. My favorite part about this is how dirty my car gets. It is fun when I get stuck, but also a little scary. It is more fun to do it with no doors or top on the car.
